## TLDR:
- **PF001 (Own Profile): Partially passed 🚧**
    - profile and stats load correctly
    - “View All” in badges is not yet implemented
    - UX Suggestion by showing stats before badges.

- **PF002 (Other Profiles): Passed ✅**
    - back button works only for public profiles.

- **🔄 Updates from last iteration**
    - Profile and badge viewing features are mostly implemented and working smoothly, with only the “View All Badges” option pending.

# WHAT WAS TESTED

- **PF001: View own profile**

    - Status: PARTIALLY PASSED 🚧
    - Not Yet Implemented: When clicking "View All" in the badge section, the user can view all available and earned badges.
    - Notes: The profile screen loads successfully. User can view the number of flashcards, quizzes, and notes created in their profile screen.
    - UX Suggestion: It might enhance the user experience if the stats were shown first, followed by the badges section.

- **PF002: View other user's profile**

    - Status: PASSED ✅
    - Notes: Profile info displays correctly with a back button on public profiles, but not on private ones; badges show correctly on own and others’ profiles.
